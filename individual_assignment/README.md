In this assignment, you will build a BookSwap app, a small marketplace where students can list textbooks they wish to exchange and initiate swap offers with other users. Unlike earlier assignments, this project requires both frontend (UI/UX with Flutter) and backend (Firebase for authentication, data storage, and real-time updates).

By completing this, you will demonstrate mastery of:

CRUD operations with Firebase (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

State management (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc) to keep the app reactive.

User authentication with Firebase Auth.

Real-time sync of listings and swap states.

Full app structure: navigation, persistence, and feature-rich UI.
